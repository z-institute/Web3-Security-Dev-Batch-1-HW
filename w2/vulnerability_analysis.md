# DaoToken

## Vulnerability Analysis

1. Balance account for voting power

token balance should not account for voting power, can use `ERC20Votes.sol` for better checkpoints implementations, `ERC20Votes.sol` extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power, the downside is that it
requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked, and to keep in mind is that voting is usually handled by governance contracts.

ps: also it save more gas, can vote without spending gas, because the delegatee is using voting on their behalf

`ERC20Votes.sol` source : <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol>

```sh
function _delegate uint256 _addrBalance = balanceOf(_addr);
```

### Improvements

1. Inherited ERC20Permit functionality allows for the delegation of voting power by signature.
